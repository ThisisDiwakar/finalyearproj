# Map with Density-Based Markers - Final

## What You Get

A clean map showing pinpoint markers for all project locations with color-coded density:

### Color Coding
- 🔴 **Red**: High density (5+ projects in that location)
- 🟠 **Orange**: Medium density (2-4 projects in that location)
- 🟢 **Green**: Low density (1 project in that location)

### Features
1. **Pinpoint Markers**: Each state-district combination gets one marker
2. **Project Count Badge**: Shows number of projects at that location
3. **Animated Effects**: Drop-in animation and pulsing ring
4. **Legend**: Bottom-right corner shows color meaning
5. **Interactive Popups**: Click markers to see details

## How It Works

### Automatic Grouping
- Projects are grouped by State + District
- Each unique location gets one marker
- Marker color based on project count at that location
- Coordinates averaged for accurate placement

### Examples

**Tamil Nadu - Chennai (8 projects)**
- Shows 🔴 Red marker (high density)
- Badge shows "8"
- Popup shows all 8 projects' statistics

**Kerala - Thiruvananthapuram (2 projects)**
- Shows 🟠 Orange marker (medium density)
- Badge shows "2"
- Popup shows both projects' statistics

**Any Location (1 project)**
- Shows 🟢 Green marker (low density)
- Badge shows "1"
- Popup shows single project details
